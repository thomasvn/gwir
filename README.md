## Usage

```bash
$ gwir -h
  -days int
    	How many days back to analyze (default 7)
  -org string
    	GitHub organization to analyze
  -token string
    	Optional. Passing a GitHub Personal Access Token allows you to view private repositories and make more API requests per hour. You can also set this token as an environment variable GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN.
  -top int
    	How many top PRs/Issues to show (default 5)
  -usr string
    	GitHub user to analyze
```

## Install

```bash
RELEASE=v0.2
ARCH=macos-arm64  # macos-amd64, linux-amd64, windows-amd64

curl -L -O https://github.com/thomasvn/gwir/releases/download/$RELEASE/gwir.$ARCH.tar.gz
tar -xvf gwir.$ARCH.tar.gz
sudo mv gwir /usr/local/bin
```

Optionally, set up your Github Personal Access Token (PAT) following [this doc](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens). The PAT will need the following permission: `repo (Full control of private repositories)`.

<!--

- Enrich data when -usr flag is passsed? Not all events have associated HTML URLs.
- Validate the PAT has sufficient permissions?
